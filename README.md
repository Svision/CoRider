# CoRider

CoRider is a company-wide carpooling app built using Flutter. The app aims to promote sustainable transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and foster employee connectivity within the organization.

## Features

- User Registration and Profiles: Employees can create accounts using their company email addresses and provide their contact information, car details, and carpooling preferences.
- Ride Offerings and Requests: Users can create ride offerings with details such as departure location, destination, departure time, and available seats. They can also search and request rides based on their desired routes and preferences.
- Matching and Notifications: The app uses an algorithm to match ride offerings with ride requests based on relevant criteria. Users receive notifications when a match is found.
- Ride Management: Users can accept or decline ride requests, view their upcoming and past rides, and make modifications or cancellations as needed.
- Communication and Chat: The app includes an in-app messaging system to facilitate communication between drivers and passengers, allowing them to discuss trip details and coordinate logistics.
- Ratings and Reviews: Users can rate and review each other after completing a ride, promoting accountability and reliability within the carpooling community.
- Safety and Security: The app verifies users as genuine company employees and provides options to report safety concerns or incidents.
- Analytics and Reporting: The app collects data on carpooling usage and generates reports highlighting the environmental impact and cost savings achieved through carpooling.
- Rewards and Incentives: CoRider includes a rewards system to incentivize employees for active participation in carpooling and sustainable commuting practices.
